                <p class="text-small"> A lack of health literacy can have consequences on both a patient’s
                    personal health and the nation as a whole. On an individual level, “a person may not understand
                    essential things such as how and when to take a prescribed medication, how to know when it is
                    appropriate to go to the emergency room rather than a primary care doctor or how to explain signs
                    and symptoms they are experiencing,”.
                    From a public health perspective, reduced health literacy can lead to widespread consequences. “Low
                    health literacy is also costly for the country because when people don't understand health
                    information and instructions, they are more likely to have worse health outcomes and unnecessarily
                    use emergency room services”</p>

                <p class="text-big">Why is it important to have Health Literacy?</p>
                <p class="text-small"> You might think health literacy doesn’t matter—after all, isn’t it
                    your doctor’s job to make healthcare decisions for you? But the truth is that healthcare decisions
                    need to be collaborative. And if there are barriers to communication, that collaborative ability
                    breaks down. In India, at least nine out of 10 adults suffer from low health literacy. It is
                    reported that even in the US and the UK, more than 50 per cent of the people have low health
                    literacy; the ‘cost of ignorance’ is about $200 billion in the US alone. Such people harbour myths
                    about food and exercise, lack knowledge about symptoms of diseases, or have misinformation about the
                    body functions or the use of medicines.</p>

                    <p class="text-small">
                        With the non-availability of beds, oxygen in hospitals and lack of financial support to bear
                        medical expenditure, many patients infected by COVID-19 are indulging in self-medication in
                        India.

                        A large number of patients and their relatives are approaching pharmacies without medical
                        prescription of doctors. Almost all pharmacies, even those operated by corporate hospitals, are
                        said to be providing medicines directly to customers. Medical experts say it is a dangerous
                        trend and could lead to serious health complications among COVID-19 patients.</p>

                    <p class="text-small">
                        On May 5, Prabhjot received a WhatsApp forward from his father. It was labelled as “forwarded
                        many times”, and contained a message inciting fear about vaccines.

                        The message read: “All vaccinated people will die within 2 years: Nobel Prize Winner Luc
                        Montagnier has confirmed that there is no chance of survival for people who have received any
                        form of the vaccine.” The message, which was obviously fake, used catchy phrases. It further
                        said, “The scientific genius backed claims of other pre-eminent virologists after studying the
                        constituents of the vaccine. They will all die from antibody dependent enhancement.”

                        Astrology is witnessing a huge surge in the last one year, as panic-ridden people are flocking
                        to astrologers for solutions. Astrological websites like Astrotalks have been getting double the
                        revenue that they used to get.

                    <p class="text-small">
                        In tribal belts, the fear from vaccines is huge. People in these villages aren’t allowing anyone
                        to visit their villages, not even frontline workers. Villagers think that vaccines are killing
                        people, not the disease. The fear is stemming from misinformation around disease, resulting in a
                        big vaccine hesitancy.

                        December 2019 in Wuhan, China. The World Health Organization declared a Public Health Emergency
                        of International Concern regarding COVID-19 on 30 January 2020, and later declared a pandemic on
                        11 March 2020. As of 18 June 2021, more than 177 million cases have been confirmed, with more
                        than 3.84 million confirmed deaths attributed to COVID-19, making it one of the deadliest
                        pandemics in history.</p>

                        Some scientists believe that severe COVID-19 could potentially weaken the body’s immune response. This could lead to increased vulnerability to other infections, especially for people who are immunocompromised.Of particular concern is an infection called mucormycosis, commonly referred to as black fungus. In India, 90 people who recovered from COVID-19 died from mucormycosis, and there are calls by India’s health authorities to declare a mucormycosis epidemic.
    
                        Mucormycosis is a rare type of fungal infection that occurs through exposure to fungi called mucormycetes. It can enter the body through breathing, inhaling, and exposed wounds in the skin.</p>

As the name suggests, the White Fungus is a fungal infection that occurs mainly among immunocompromised people this includes COVID-19 positive people, those with uncontrolled diabetes and people on a high dose of steroids.However, as per experts, there is no need to panic or worry. Similar to Black Fungus, the White Fungus is a fungal infection, being found in COVID-19 patients with compromised immunity. It’s not a novel infection; it has been around for a while and only a handful of cases have been reported so fa</p>

The treatment for COVID-19 includes steroids and immunosuppressants that leave the body with weak immunity.</p>
